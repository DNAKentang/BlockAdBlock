# BlockAdBlock

Minimal implementation of Anti Adblock.

Will block access to all content on your site and Rick Roll users to help worsen the user experience.

## My site is covered in important adverts that cover the main content on mobile. How can I use this?

Use the minimal demo as an example for setup.

## That's confusing. My site is dangerously usable. Help me change it now!

This is exactly what jsdelivr was made for.

Add this script tag literally anywhere.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/HughParry/BlockAdBlock/demo/src/assets/bundle.js"></script>

## I have some ideas about how I can make the internet a worse place. How can I help?

Contributions are welcome, just make a PR.
