# BlockAdBlock

Minimal implementation of Anti Adblock.

Will block access to all content on your site and Rick Roll users to help worsen the user experience.

## My site is covered in important adverts that cover the main content on mobile. How can I use this?

Use the minimal demo as an example for setup.

## That's confusing. My site is dangerously usable. Help me change it now!

Add this script tag literally anywhere then.

## I have some ideas about how I can make the internet a worse place. How can I help?

Contributions are welcome, just make a PR.
